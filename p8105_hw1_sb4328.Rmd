This is my solution to Homework 1.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Problem 1
Create a data frame comprised of the specified elements

```{r}
prob1df =
  tibble(
      samp = rnorm(10),
      samp_gt_0 = samp > 0,
      char_vec = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"),
      factor_vec = factor(c("low", "low", "low", "mod", "mod", "mod", "mod","high", "high", "high"))
)
```
Take the mean of each variable in my data frame
```{r}
mean(pull(prob1df, samp))
mean(pull(prob1df, samp_gt_0))
mean(pull(prob1df, char_vec))
mean(pull(prob1df, factor_vec))
```
The mean for my samp is 0.1026824 and the mean for my sample greater than zero is 0.6 but I could not get the mean for a character vector or the factor vector.
